# Data Analysis and Visualization Toolkit

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of statistical and visualization libraries such as `math`, `statistics`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `plotnine`. It covers a range of descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, percentiles, and plotting techniques.

## Features

- Statistical calculations:
  - Mean, weighted mean, harmonic mean, and geometric mean
  - Variance and standard deviation
  - Skewness and percentiles
- Dataset manipulation using `pandas` and `numpy`
- Data visualization with:
  - `matplotlib`: Simple and box plots
  - `plotnine`: Advanced plotting inspired by ggplot in R
- Importing datasets similar to R (e.g., `economics`, `mpg`).

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
plotnine
```
how run this project 

```py
python statistixspythonfile.py
```
